discbot.py: contains commands in a Cog for using an invite-only channel (can be text or voice, because its done through a role.)
At the moment, role has to be set up prior to using the bot. This wont' be the case forever, but its far too
ambitious for me to try to start adding features like that when it doesnt even work
