iocbot.py: 
    Handles reserving invite-only channel(s) (can be text or voice, because its done through a role.)
    At the moment, role has to be set up prior to using the bot. This won't be the case forever, I hope.
    (that and other feature brainstorming in a TODO comment at the top of the code)
    
deckbot.py:
    (OLD)
    Meant as a deck of cards bot in a discord for D&D.
